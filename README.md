# SpaceIInvader

###ðŸ“– Project Summary

This project was built in Unity with VContainer (a dependency injection framework for Unity) as part of an interview test assignment. It demonstrates clean architecture practices, modular design, and the ability to structure gameplay logic (player movement, shooting, enemy waves, scoring, etc.) in a maintainable and extensible way. While small in scope, the project emphasizes code quality, testability, and good engineering practices rather than raw content size.
